All animations not loaded at runtime and their objects they are associated with go here.
When creating an animation, make a folder under sources with the object containing the animation and in animations named after the object.
Import the animated object into its source folder, then copy the .anim file from the object in sources to its animations folder.
Create the animation controller for the object and put it in the AnimationControllers folder.
